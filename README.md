# soundbox
A super simple JS library for playing sound effects and other audio.

 * Current size: `1.4kb`
 * Current minified size: `0.74kb`

[Demo](https://sbrl.github.io/soundbox/example.html)

## To use:

### With callbacks

```javascript
var soundbox = new SoundBox();
soundbox.load("beep", "beep.wav", function() {
    console.log("Loaded beep!");
}); // The callback is optional

// Later....
soundbox.play("beep", function() {
	// Do stuff
}); // This callback is also optional
// The 3rd parameter is the volume: It should be between 0 and 1
soundbox.play("beep", some_callback, 0.8);
```

### With Promises

```javascript
var soundbox = new SoundBox();
soundbox.load("beep-a", "beep-a.wav")
    .then(
        () => console.log("Loaded beep a!"),
        () => console.error("Failed to load keep a :-(")
    );
soundbox.load("beep-b", "beep-b.wav");
soundbox.load("beep-c", "beep-c.wav");
soundbox.load("victory", "victory.mp3");

soundbox.play("beep-a")
    .then(() => soundbox.play("beep-b"))
    .then(() => soundbox.play("beep-c"))
    .then(() => soundbox.play("victory"));
    
// The 3rd parameter is the volume: The callback can be omitted to enable promise mode
soundbox.play("beep", null, 0.8)
    .then(() => soundbox.play("victory"))
```

### Additional Functionality
Get the current version of SoundBox:

```javascript
console.log(`Soundbox is at ${SoundBox.version}`);
```

## Download
The recommended way to obtain soundbox is via [npm](https://npmjs.org/) here: [sound-box](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sound-box) - To install it simply type `npm install sound-box`. Then you can include any of the 4 files described below from the `./node_modules/sound-box/` directory.

If npm isn't for you, then the latest master should be perfectly stable. If you want something that you know will work, try the latest [release](https://github.com/sbrl/soundbox/releases).

The following files are available in all release methods:
 * [soundbox.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbrl/soundbox/master/soundbox.js) - The main development version.
 * [soundbox.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbrl/soundbox/master/soundbox.min.js) - A minified version of the above.
 * [soundbox.jsm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbrl/soundbox/master/soundbox.jsm) - An ES6 module-compatible version that's autogenerated. If you possibly can, I'd advise learning about about them. [This is a useful resource](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/).
 * [soundbox.jsm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbrl/soundbox/master/soundbox.min.jsm) - A minified version of the above.


## Changelog
 * v0.2: Now with button mashing support!
 * v0.3: Added volume support! Converted for use as an ES6 module. If this doesn't suit you, then just remove the `import` and `export` statements to make it the way it was before.
 * v0.3.1: Added non-es6 version and build system to automate minification.
